list-service-accounts:
  description: |
    List all service accounts created by this charm (i.e., with the prefix
    `juju-gcp-`), both active and unknown (i.e., created by another instance
    of this charm or no longer in use).
purge-unknown-service-accounts:
  description: |
    Purge service accounts created by this charm (i.e., with the prefix
    `juju-gcp-`) that are no longer in active use by this charm.

    Be careful! There is no way for this action to determine if these accounts
    are in use elsewhere, such as in another model. Running this action while
    there are accounts in use elsewhere will likely break the applications
    depending on those accounts.
